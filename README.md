# node-cef: A CEF and Syslog Logging Library

The Common Event Format, or CEF, is a [standard proposed by
ArcSight](http://www.arcsight.com/collateral/CEFstandards.pdf) for
logging event data.  This module provides a CEF formatter and logger
that by default emits messages to the syslog over udp.  The syslogger
is pluggable, so if the default does not fit your needs, you can
change it.

`node-cef` is intended to be used alongside other logging facilities.
Note that it doesn't actually print anything to the console or any
files by default; its sole purpose is to emit CEF strings to a syslog
service.

## Installation

```
npm install cef
```

## Example

```javascript
var cef = require('cef');

// Create a configuration for your application and your syslog interface
var config = {
  vendor: 'Steinway',
  product: 'Piano',
  version: 'B',
  syslog_tag: 'my-piano',
  syslog_facility: 'local4'
};

// Get a singleton instance for this config
var logger = cef.getInstance(config);

logger.info({signature: "Bflat", name: "Out of tune"});
```

This will emit a message like the following to the system log:

```
<166> Jul 18 02:16:12 my-piano[17016] CEF:0|Steinway|Piano|B|Bflat|Out of tune|4
```

(I don't actually own a Steinway B, but I wish I did.)

## Logger Parameters

CEF requires log messages to have the following parameters:

- *Vendor*: A string identifying your organization
- *Product*: A string identifying your product
- *Version*: A string identifying the version of your product
- *Signature*: An arbitrary key identifying the type of event logged.
  Typically a four-digit number.
- *Name*: A human-readable phrase describing the event.
- *Severity*: An integer between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest severity)

Out of these six parameters, and also the CEF version number (0 at the
time of this writing), A cef string of the following form will be
constructed:

```
CEF:<cef_version>|<vendor>|<product>|<version>|<signature>|<name>|<severity>
```

Additionally, any number of key-value pairs specifying extra data can
be attached.  Such key value pairs are referred to as extensions.  The
CEF standard declares some 28 extensions, and ArcSight has 462 more.

The formatter ensures that extension keys belong to the set of CEF
extensions or a subset of the ArcSight extensions.  It also verifies
their values are of their required type (e.g., `dmac` is a valid MAC
addr, etc.).  If you need more extensions than are permitted here,
please submit an issue or, better yet, modify `lib/extensions.js` and
send me a pull request.

The `node-cef` logger can be instantiated with any number of default
parameters, with the various logging methods specifying the remaining
required parameters.  For example:

```javascript
// Application config
var logger = new cef.Logger({
  vendor: "Initech",
  product: "Stapler",
  version: 2
});

logger.warn({
  signature: 42,
  name: "Attempted theft detected",
  extensions: {
    suser: "Milton",
    msg: "Burn it down!"
  }
});
```

Will log the following:

```
CEF:0|Initech|Stapler|2|42|Attempted theft detected|6|suser=Milton solution=Burn it down!
```

## CEF Levels and Syslog Severities

CEF defines 11 levels (0 to 10, lowest to highest); syslog defines
eight levels (7 to 0, debug to emerg).  To align these two, we declare
CEF 10 to be equivalent to syslog `emerg` (0), CEF 9 = syslog `alert` (1),
and so on to CEF 3 = syslog `debug` (7).  We do not use CEF levels 2, 1,
or 0.

The `node-cef` logger has methods named after the syslog severities:

- `emergency()`
- `alert()`
- `critical()`
- `error()`
- `warning()` or `warn()`
- `notice()` (the default level for calling `log()`)
- `info()`
- `debug()`

It's up to you to decide with your team on a set of meanings and stick
with them.  For example, for logging
[BrowserID](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid) events at Mozilla,
we use four levels as follows:

- `emerg` (10) Completely out of whack.  Someone needs to look at
   this.  Harm to the application, user account, or system security
   could have taken place.

- `alert` (8) Suspicious activity or application has non-validated
   user input. Impact is not known.

- `warn` (6) Normal security application stuff, login failures,
   password changes.

- `info` (4) Normal app activity.  Logins and various kinds of
  transactions.

## Syslog Transports

By default, `node-cef` uses a udp syslog transport.  You can configure
the transport with the following options to the `Logger` constructor:

- `syslog_tag`: The name of your app to appear in the syslog.  Default
  is `__filename`, which you probably want to change.

- `syslog_facility`: One of the facility names or numbers as defined
  in RFC 3164.  Default is `user`.

- `syslog_address`: IP address of the syslog service.  Default is
  `127.0.0.1`.

- `syslog_port`: Port for the syslog service.  Default is `514`.

- `syslog_transport`: A function taking two arguments: `message` and
  `callback`.  By default, this is a udp4 transport using the address
  and port described above.

Within the transport function, address and port are available as
`this.address` and `this.port`.  You could specify a transport using
some custom service like so:

```javascript
var config = {
  syslog_address: '192.168.1.42',
  syslog_port: 9876,
  syslog_transport: function(message, callback) {
    myCustomService.send(
      new Buffer(message),
      this.port,
      this.address,
      callback
    );
  }
};
```

## Dependencies

- [node-dateformat](https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/)

## Testing

Tests are written using [vows](http://vowsjs.org/).

Run `npm test` to run the test suite.  You may have to run `npm install` first.
